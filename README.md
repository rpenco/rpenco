### My Experience in Big Data

I usually work on big-data projects, which use technologies like
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/kafka-red?logo=apachekafka" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/kafka-red?logo=apachekafka),
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/spark-red?logo=apachespark" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/spark-red?logo=apachespark),
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/flink-red?logo=apacheflink" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/spark-red?logo=apacheflink), and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/elastic-red?logo=elastic" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/elastic-red?logo=elastic) stack for stream processing
and deployed on [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-cyan?logo=kubernetes" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/spark-red?logo=kubernetes) platforms with
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/helm-cyan?logo=helm" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/helm-cyan?logo=helm) or more traditionally on virtual machines using [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ansible-cyan?logo=ansible" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/ansible-red?logo=ansible)

See [punch platform](https://doc.punchplatform.com) project for example.

### My Experience in Web

I built frontend sites and applications with the latest framework. Here just to list a few.
* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-red?logo=angular" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-red?logo=angular) with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/primeract-red?logo=primeface" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/nuxt.js-red?logo=nuxt.js), in my previous projects
* [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react.js-red?logo=react" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/react.js-red?logo=react), with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/react--redux-red?logo=redux" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/react--redux-red?logo=redux) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/antd-red?logo=ant-design" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/antd-red?logo=ant-design) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/styled--components-red?logo=styled-components" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/styled--components-red?logo=styled-components), in my last projects

In case when using framwork seem like an overkill, I often will set up my own [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-green?logo=webpack" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-green?logo=webpack) bundler with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-green?logo=typescript" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-green?logo=typescript) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/eslint-green?logo=eslint" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/eslint-green?logo=eslint) support to facilitate project development.

It would be worth to mention that when dealing with frontend, I also get involved with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/socket.io-orange?logo=socket.io" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/socket.io-orange?logo=socket.io) and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/json--web--tokens-orange?logo=json-web-tokens" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/json--web--tokens-orange?logo=json-web-tokens) in various project features, such as multi-client communication and authentication.

### My Experience in API, Backend and Database

In developing API, 
I have hands-on experience on traditional 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/php-purple?logo=php" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-purple?logo=php) 
and a more modern solutions like 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-purple?logo=express" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-purple?logo=express), 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/springboot-purple?logo=springboot" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-purple?logo=express), and more recently 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/gin--gonic-purple?logo=go" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/gin.js-purple?logo=gin). 

In testing API, I prefer tools like [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/mocky-purple?logo=mocky-io" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/mocky-purple?logo=mocky-io) or [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/postman-purple?logo=postman" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/postman-purple?logo=postman)
whenever I am able to set up my own locals.

I also have some experience in 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-light--green?logo=postgresql" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/elasticsearch-light--green?logo=postgres), 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/elasticsearch-light--green?logo=elasticsearch" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/elasticsearch-light--green?logo=elasticsearch), 
and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/mongoDB-light--green?logo=mongoDB" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/mongoDB-light--green?logo=mongoDB) development, with knowledge in schema model and field selection and population.

### My Favourite Programming Environment


I love to solve problem with [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-yellow?logo=typescript" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-yellow?logo=javascript) and also 
[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/go-yellow?logo=go" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-yellow?logo=go), 
in particular I am still fascinated by the beauty with their functional programming aspect. That being said, I am still a fan on conventional object-oriented paradigm in languages like [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-yellow?logo=c%2B%2B" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-yellow?logo=c%2B%2B), or [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/java-yellow?logo=java" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-yellow?logo=java). 

I mainly use [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJ-pink?logo=intellijidea" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJ-pink?logo=intellijidea) for development, and [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/gitlab-pink?logo=gitlab" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitlab-pink?logo=gitlab) CI/CD for testing and integration

For scripting langages, I like to have [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/shell--script-yellow?logo=shell" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/shell--script-yellow?logo=shell) by my side. And the more I work with Linux, the more I find how handy command-line interface is. Although I could use [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/vim-pink?logo=vim" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/vim-pink?logo=vim) or [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/nano-pink?logo=nano" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/nano-pink?logo=nano) in CLI, I more often stick to the friendly [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-pink?logo=visual-studio-code" height="14"/>](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-pink?logo=visual-studio-code) for editing purpose.
